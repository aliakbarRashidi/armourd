<p>armourd is a Linux daemon for service recovery and is targeted for use in
embedded systems running GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>When a watched application crashes, armourd will automatically restart it. To
watch an application armourd only needs the file path of the application
executable; no PID files, no shell scripts. This is achieved by jointly
tracking the creation/termination of processes and collecting process
information.</p>

<p>It works out of the box, as it takes roughly a couple of minutes to set it up.
Upon startup armourd interprets its configuration file which lists the 
pathnames of the services that need to be watched.</p>

<p>armourd recovers processes that stopped abnormally, by returning a nonzero exit
code; it does not recover applications hanging. Forking servers will have their
children terminate before restart. Although it is designed to recover system
daemon programs, it can actually recover any application, with the limitation
that currently only supports single-instance applications unless using the DBus
interface (see below).</p>

<p>armourd is Linux-only by design, because it relies upon interfaces such as
epoll(7) or netlink(7) and proc(5) files that aren't available in other unices.
It is more suited to sysvinit-based systems; newer init systems, such as
upstart or systemd, service recovery is readily available.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can build the daemon with 
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/">DBus</a> support to commuincate 
with other applications. The DBus API exposes runtime information, and a method
to watch running processes.</p>

<h2>
<a name="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>simplest possible configuration</li>
<li>no library dependencies (other than the C library)</li>
<li>small memory footprint</li>
<li>fast recovery of processes</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Populate the config file with the (absolute) pathnames of your applications,
e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>    $ echo '/opt/foo' &gt; /etc/armourd.conf
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use file-name globs ('*' wildcard). For example, to add all the
binaries under /usr/local/bin/:</p>

<pre><code>    $ echo '/usr/local/bin/*' &gt; /etc/armourd.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, you may explicitly request to watch a running process, using
DBus, e.g. with <code>dbus-send</code> you would:</p>

<pre><code>    $ dbus-send --session --print-reply --type=method_call \
    &gt; --dest=com.github.Armourd /com/github/armourd \
    &gt; com.github.Armourd.WatchProcess int32:`pidof foo`
</code></pre>

<p>Or, using the provided example Python script:</p>

<pre><code>    $ ./client-example.py -w`pidof foo`
</code></pre>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2>
<a name="testsuite" class="anchor" href="#testsuite"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testsuite</h2>

<p>Current version is not production ready, as there aren't any tests.  Unit tests
to exercise the API's and integration tests to check the runtime behaviour are
a must.  This could be added as a configure option (e.g. --enable-tests) then
the user can run the make <em>check</em> target</p>

<h2>
<a name="notes" class="anchor" href="#notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes</h2>

<p>armourd just does individual service recovery; it does not perform system
recovery, i.e. talk to watchdog hardware.  In order to make your system fully
reliable, you should have a process feeding a watchdog, although your mileage
may vary.  Linux provides a very simple interface to watchdog timers
(<code>/dev/watchdog</code>) that armourd will implement as a non-default feature, to
provide an all-round solution.</p>

<h2>
<a name="todo" class="anchor" href="#todo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TODO</h2>

<ul>
<li>Testsuite</li>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Configuration file parser needs to be rewritten (it is buggy)</li>
<li>Enable options in the configuration file and DBus interface to tailor
specific needs, e.g. return codes for success or a recover script</li>
<li>watchdog capabilities</li>
